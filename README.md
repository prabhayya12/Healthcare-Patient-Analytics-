# Healthcare Patient Analytics

## Objective

- **Analyze patient demographics and treatment outcomes**
- **Identify common diseases and their treatments**
- **Predict hospital readmission rates**

## Tools Used

- **Python:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), machine learning
- **Power BI:** Dashboard creation and data visualization
- **Excel:** Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **MySQL:** Data storage and advanced queries

## Dataset

The dataset consists of patient records with the following columns:

- Patient ID
- Age
- Gender
- Disease
- Treatment
- Admission Date
- Discharge Date
- Readmission

> **Sample Data Source:** Hospital General Information

## Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning (Excel):**
   - Remove duplicates
   - Handle missing or inconsistent values

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (Python):**
   - Identify trends (e.g., most common diseases by age group)
   - Visualization of disease and treatment distributions

3. **Database Storage (MySQL):**
   - Store the cleaned data for complex queries
   - Generate reports (e.g., readmission rates, treatment durations)

4. **Dashboard Creation (Power BI):**
   - Build interactive dashboards to visualize patient trends
   - Present insights on demographics, diseases, and outcomes

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prabhayya12/Healthcare-Patient-Analytics-.git
   ```

2. **Explore the code and datasets**
   - Notebooks and scripts are provided for data cleaning and EDA
   - SQL scripts for database setup and queries
   - Power BI dashboard files for visualization

3. **Customize for your own data**
   - Replace the sample dataset with your hospital data
   - Update scripts as needed for your schema
